# PORTFOLIO API

This is my Portfolio backend section.
Here I've migrated the db (also managed with PHPMyAdmin, local server with MAMP), seeded and made the necessary models of the tables, also connected one-to-many and many-to-many the main tables.
I've created the controllers and setted the routes, so the methods. Created all the necessary CRUD views.
